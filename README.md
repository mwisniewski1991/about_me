## My Projects

### Budget Tracker
*In progress project*

**Goal**: Develop a web app for tracking household incomes and expenses.

**Description**: 
In the past I use Excel to track my budget. Now I want to try to create my own app on which I will learn how to manage longer projects and make app improvments.

**Stack**:
- Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy, WTForms)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Others: Docker, Nginx

**Key Learning**: Proper design of the database schema is crucial. Changes after project initiation are challenging to implement.
