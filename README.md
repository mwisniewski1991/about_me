## My Projects

### Budget Tracker
*In progress project*

https://github.com/mwisniewski1991/budget_tracker

**Goal**: Develop a web app for tracking household incomes and expenses.

**Description**: 
In the past I use Excel to track my budget. Now I want to try to create my own app on which I will learn how to manage longer projects and make app improvments.

**Stack**:
- Python 
    - Flask, 
    - SQLAlchemy 
    - WTForms
- Database: 
    - PostgreSQL
- Others: 
    - Docker


### Spark on Mikrus

**Goal**: Learning to create and manage a Spark cluster

**Description**: 
On the mikr.us platform, I aim to learn how distributed computing applications work in a development environment. Learning distributed computing applications in a server environment makes more sense to me than running everything on a local machine. Since mikr.us has shared resources, running a full-fledged Spark instance is not feasible on this platform.

**Stack**:
- Python 
    - PySpark
- Computation
    - Spark
- Others: 
    - Docker
